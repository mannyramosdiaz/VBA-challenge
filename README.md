VBA Homework

The purpose of this code is to summarize the information of stocks over a year to view their percent increase or decrease, yearly change and Total Stock Volume.
Also a to identify the stock with the greatest percent increase, percent decrease and greatest total value of stocks in the data.


P.D.
In this homework I will include a VBA script for each challenge. The homework said scripts plural, which was confusing. The VBA script 
"VbaChallenge2" will run on all pages (challenge 2) and with the with Greateast % Increase, Decrease and Total Volume (Challenge 1).
"VbaChallenge1" script will only run the assignment with with the greatest % increase, decrease and total volume (challenge1) on one page.
The "VbaBasic" will run the work with the ticker, yearly change, yearly %, and the color formatting, which all the previously listed 
already do. The most complete is "VbaChallenge2". The instructions were very convoluted mentioning each file.
